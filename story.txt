The alarm blared loudly. Bob snoozed it for the 10th time that morning. He knew he had a class in 15 minutes but he just didn't have the energy to get himself out of bed. He was up until 2 am the night before, working on CS project. The project was much harder than he expected, and it did not help that he waited until a day before the deadline to work on it. The alarm screamed again. Bob finally pulled himself out of the bed. He dragged his feet to the bathroom and freshened up for his Zoom class. The class required that he had to turn on his video. As he got ready, he scrolled through all the throwback pictures on Instagram, wishing it was still summer. He quickly made himself a bowl of cereal and turned on his laptop. He went to the Zoom link for his Math class, and his professor had already started writing information on the screen. He took a bite of his cereal and glanced at the screen only to realize that his Math exam was in 2 hours. His professor was doing a review session in class!
